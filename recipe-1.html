        <li>Pecorino cheese, <em>50g</em></li>
        <li>Parmesan, <em>50g</em></li>

        <li>Plump garlic cloves <em>(2)</em>, peeled left and whole</li>
        <li>Unsalted butter, <em>50g</em></li>
        <li>Sea salt</li>
        <li>Ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put a large saucepan of water to boil.</li>
        <li>Finely chop the 100g <b>pancetta</b>, having first removed any rind.<br>
            Finely grate 50g <b>pecorino cheese</b> and 50g <b>parmesan</b> and mix them together.</li>
        <li>Beat the 3 <b>large eggs</b> in a medium bowl and season with a little freshly <b>graded black pepper</b>.<br>
            Set everything aside. </li>
        <li>Add 1 teaspoon of <b>salt</b> to the boiling water, add 350g of <b>spaghetti</b> and when the water comes back to the boil,
            cook at a constant simmer, covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente (just cooked).</li>
        <li>Squash 2 peeled <b>plump garlic clovers</b>s with the blade of a knife, just to bruise it.</li>
        <li>While <b>the spaghetti</b> is cooking, fry <b>the pancetta</b> with the garlic.<br>
            Drop 50g unsalted butter into a large frying pan or wok and, as soon as the butter has melted, tip the pancceta and garlic.</li>
        <li>Leave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until <b>the pancetta</b> is golden and crisp.<br>
            <b>The garlic</b> has now imparted its flavour, so take it out with a slotted spoon and discard.</li>
        <li>Keep the heat under <b>the pancetta</b> on low.<br>
            When <b>he pasta</b> is ready, lift it from the water with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in the frying pan with <b>the pancetta.</b><br>
            Don't worry if a little water drops in the pan as well (you want this to happen) and don't throw <b>the pasta</b> water away yet.</li>
        <li>Mix most of <b>the chesse</b> in with <b>the eggs</b>, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over later.</li>
        <li>Take the pan of <b>spaghetti</b> and <b>pancetta</b> off the heat.<br>
            Now quickly pour in the <b>eggs and cheese</b>.<br>
            Using the tongs or a long fork, lift up <b>the spaghetti</b> so it mixes easily with <b>the egg</b> mixture, which thickens but doesn't scramble, and everything is coated.</li>
        <li>Add extra <b>pasta</b> cooking water to keep it saucy (several tablespoons should do it).<br>
            You don't want it wet, just moist.<br>
            Season with a little <b>salt</b>, if needed.</li>
        <li>Use a long-pronged fork to twist <b>the pasta</b> on to the serving plate or bowl.<br>
            Serve immediately with a little sprinkling of the remaining <b>cheese</b> and a granting of <b>black pepper</b>.<br>
            If the dish does get a little dry before serving, splash in some more hot <b>pasta</b> water and the glossy sauciness will be revived.</li>
    </ol>
